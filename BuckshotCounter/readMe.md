## Hello World!
I am GavinTheGreat19 and I have developed: **BUCKSHOT COUNTER**.
I developed it after playing the game *[Buckshot Roulette](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette)* by *Mike Klubnika*
I was having trouble counting the shells left in the gun, so I developed this handy dandy tool to keep track of them.
Over time I just kept adding more and more stuff until I thought it was appropriate to release it as a project on the High Seas.

## Features:
- Easy to use button interface for counting shells
- Custom Graphics created by me :D
- Live Probabilities for the shells
- Dynamic Sound Effects for adding and removing shells
- and... ***A Functional Shotgun***

I tried to make the shotgun as fun as I could to interact with. You have to click it once to rack it, and then once more to fire it. The gun uses the before mentioned
probabilities to determine whether or not to fire a live round or a blank round. It will automatically fire a blank if there is no ammo for the gun. It also will subtract
ammo from the counter to further simulate the gun. This effectively allows you to play a very bare bones version of *Buckshot Roulette* in your browser.

I hope you enjoy!

P.S. I Recomend Using CTRL + Mouse Wheel to zoom out to fit the whole page.
