USE WASD TO MOVE
# Hello World!
It is I, GavinTheGreat19

Before me I have what is a monstrocity of mushy code and strange work arounds.

I Have made a continous movement script with JavaScript that works directly onto HTML, *without the use of the canvas element...*

## Why??
That is a very good question. I couldn't figure out how to use the canvas element, so I decided to make something that changes the absoloute positions of the <img> Html element.

## Here are all of the cool things it has!

* Continous WASD Movment.
* Pre-rendered 3D Graphics (Made by me with Blender)
* A Scrolling Background Effect
* A Cool Donut (that breaks the website when you touch it)
* Copyrighted music from Nintendo
* bricks that colide with the player, even if they are like 32 pixels away, but only on the X axis.
